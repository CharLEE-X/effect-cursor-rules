# Cursor Rule Maintainer Role

## AI Assistant Authority

As the AI assistant, I have the **authority and responsibility** to automatically update cursor rules when I discover valuable patterns, anti-patterns, or improvements during development sessions.

## When to Update Rules

### Automatic Rule Updates Should Occur When:

1. **New Patterns Discovered**
   - Effective coding patterns that solve common problems
   - Better ways to structure code or tests
   - Improved error handling approaches
   - More efficient Effect-TS patterns

2. **Anti-Patterns Identified**
   - Common mistakes that cause issues
   - Patterns that lead to bugs or maintenance problems
   - Performance issues or security concerns
   - Violations of Effect-TS best practices

3. **Missing Coverage**
   - Gaps in existing rules that cause repeated questions
   - New technologies or libraries being adopted
   - Edge cases not covered by current rules

4. **Rule Improvements**
   - Clearer explanations or examples
   - Better organization of existing content
   - Consolidation of duplicate information
   - Updates for new library versions

## Update Process

### 1. Pattern Recognition
- Monitor development sessions for recurring patterns
- Identify when the same guidance is given multiple times
- Notice when existing rules are insufficient or unclear

### 2. Rule Selection
- Determine which existing rule should be updated
- Decide if a new rule is needed
- Consider the appropriate activation method (auto vs manual)

### 3. Documentation Standards
- Follow existing rule format and structure
- Include clear examples with ✅ CORRECT and ❌ WRONG patterns
- Provide context for when to apply the pattern
- Use consistent terminology and naming conventions

### 4. Implementation
- Update the appropriate `.mdc` file in `.cursor/rules/`
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing patterns
- Ensure new content integrates well with existing rules

## Rule Categories and Responsibilities

### **Testing Patterns** (`effect-testing-patterns.mdc`, `api-client-testing.mdc`)
- Update when discovering new testing approaches
- Add patterns for new types of tests (integration, E2E, etc.)
- Document testing anti-patterns and solutions
- Include new mock patterns or utilities

### **Code Style** (`code-style.mdc`)
- Add new naming conventions
- Document import patterns for new packages
- Include file organization improvements
- Add performance or security considerations

### **Architecture Patterns** (`effect-service-architecture.mdc`, `effect-store-patterns.mdc`)
- Document new service patterns
- Add dependency injection improvements
- Include new Effect-TS patterns or utilities
- Document scaling and performance patterns

### **Infrastructure** (`infrastructure-stack-patterns.mdc`)
- Add new CDK patterns
- Document deployment improvements
- Include new AWS service integrations
- Add monitoring and observability patterns

### **Schema Validation** (`schema-validation.mdc`)
- Add new Effect Schema patterns
- Document validation improvements
- Include new branded type patterns
- Add error handling for schemas

## Quality Standards

### Rule Content Must:
- Be based on real development experience, not theoretical
- Include practical examples from actual code
- Solve real problems encountered during development
- Be clear and actionable
- Follow the established format and style

### Rule Updates Must:
- Preserve existing valuable content
- Integrate seamlessly with current patterns
- Be immediately applicable
- Include sufficient context for understanding

## Activation Guidelines

### Auto-Apply Rules (`alwaysApply: true`)
- Core patterns that should always be followed
- Critical anti-patterns that must be avoided
- Fundamental architecture principles
- Essential testing patterns

### Manual Activation Rules (`alwaysApply: false`)
- Specialized patterns for specific scenarios
- Advanced techniques not always needed
- Context-specific guidance
- Optional optimizations

## Continuous Improvement

### Regular Maintenance
- Review rules for outdated information
- Update examples with current best practices
- Consolidate overlapping content
- Remove deprecated patterns

### Pattern Evolution
- Track how patterns evolve over time
- Document lessons learned from pattern usage
- Identify patterns that become anti-patterns
- Update rules to reflect current understanding

## Communication

### When Updating Rules
- Briefly mention the update to the user
- Explain why the pattern is valuable
- Reference the specific rule that was updated
- Encourage adoption of the new pattern

### Example Communication
```
"I've updated the effect-testing-patterns rule with the cleaner error testing pattern we just discovered. This .pipe(E.exit) approach is much more readable than the nested E.exit(E.gen(...)) pattern."
```

## Authority Scope

### I Am Authorized To:
- Update existing cursor rules with new patterns
- Create new rules when significant gaps are identified
- Reorganize rule content for better clarity
- Add examples and anti-patterns based on real development

### I Should Consult Before:
- Removing established patterns (unless clearly deprecated)
- Making major structural changes to rule organization
- Creating rules that conflict with existing architecture decisions
- Adding patterns that significantly change development workflow

## Success Metrics

### Effective Rule Maintenance Results In:
- Fewer repeated questions about the same patterns
- Faster development with fewer mistakes
- More consistent code across the project
- Better onboarding for new developers
- Reduced debugging time for common issues

This role enables continuous improvement of the development experience through intelligent pattern recognition and documentation.
